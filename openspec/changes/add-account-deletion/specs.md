</task>

<project_context>
<!-- This is background information for you. Do NOT include this in your output. -->
Project: Storio 2
Metaphor: A quiet, sophisticated digital Pensieve or Folio for collecting movies, series, and books. Use terms like 'Folio', 'Stories', 'Memories'. AVOID terms like 'Desert', 'Sand', 'Dig'.
Tech Stack:
  - Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS. Mobile-first design focusing on iPhone 16 Pro.
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python) on Vercel Serverless Functions.
  - Database & Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Supabase Auth.
Design System:
  - Dark mode only. Colors: #0d0d0d (Folio Black), #121212 (Card Surface), #c5a059 (Storio Gold).

Read these files for context before creating this artifact:

<dependency id="proposal" status="done">
  <path>/Users/iTubai/Sites/storio_2/openspec/changes/add-account-deletion/proposal.md</path>
  <description>Initial proposal document outlining the change</description>
</dependency>

<instruction>
Create specification files that define WHAT the system should do.

Create one spec file per capability listed in the proposal's Capabilities section.
- New capabilities: use the exact kebab-case name from the proposal (specs/<capability>/spec.md).
- Modified capabilities: use the existing spec folder name from openspec/specs/<capability>/ when creating the delta spec at specs/<capability>/spec.md.

Delta operations (use ## headers):
- **ADDED Requirements**: New capabilities
- **MODIFIED Requirements**: Changed behavior - MUST include full updated content
- **REMOVED Requirements**: Deprecated features - MUST include **Reason** and **Migration**
- **RENAMED Requirements**: Name changes only - use FROM:/TO: format

Format requirements:
- Each requirement: `### Requirement: <name>` followed by description
- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may)
- Each scenario: `#### Scenario: <name>` with WHEN/THEN format
- **CRITICAL**: Scenarios MUST use exactly 4 hashtags (`####`). Using 3 hashtags or bullets will fail silently.
- Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

MODIFIED requirements workflow:
1. Locate the existing requirement in openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md
2. Copy the ENTIRE requirement block (from `### Requirement:` through all scenarios)
3. Paste under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect new behavior
4. Ensure header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive)

Common pitfall: Using MODIFIED with partial content loses detail at archive time.
If adding new concerns without changing existing behavior, use ADDED instead.

Example:
```
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: User can export data
The system SHALL allow users to export their data in CSV format.

#### Scenario: Successful export
- **WHEN** user clicks "Export" button
- **THEN** system downloads a CSV file with all user data

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Legacy export
**Reason**: Replaced by new export system
**Migration**: Use new export endpoint at /api/v2/export
```

Specs should be testable - each scenario is a potential test case.
